Question 1:

When we don't use SH/PR, test3.cfg and test4.cfg we can observe a bouncing effect in both tet3 and test 4. - That is, both test consist of several network pathologies during link failures.

In test3.cfg:
	At time t=12, a packet with src=0 and dst=4 is sent while the link (R0:3 I0:1 W0:1)<-->(R1:4 I1:0 W1:1) is down. 
	This packet is going back and forth between router 1 and router 2 until it is finally re-routed to router 5 from router 2 (At t=24). 

	At t=50. the same thing happens as a packet with src=0 and dst=5 is doing exactlt the same, going repeatedly from/to routers 1 and 2.

In test4.cfg:

	We see the exact same behvior. For instance, at time=40 a packet with src=7 and dst=2 is sent.
	This packet is also bouncing back and forth between routers 5 and 6 without stopping.


Question 2:

When we enable SH/PR, the aforementioned pathology from question 1 is fixed. Thus,

In test3.cfg: 
	Router 0's routing table for destination 4 is set to INFINITY for the same packet sent at t=12,
	causing the packet to be dropped, and thus, preventing the infinity counting between routers 1 and 2. This happens as well for the packet sent at t=50. Now this packet is being dropped at t=51 since the metrics of router 1's routing table for destination 5 is set to be INFINITE.

In test4.cfg:
	At t=40, the packet with src=7 and dst=2 is being routed to routers 6 and 4 twice, and then, it is dropped at t=47 after the second time. We can infer from that, that when SH/PR is enabled, a packet is prevented from being delievered thru the same link more than once.
